🧑‍🔬 As an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate from [Sri Lanka Technological Campus](www.sltc.ac.lk), I'm interested in all things electronic and programming related. I'm also working full-time as an Embedded Systems Engineering Intern at Atlas Populi Labs to complete my internship. I spend most of my time working on my campus work, developing engineering designs at my workplace and writing different pieces of code in my free time. I also like to fix electronic equipment and even design my own if I get the chance.

## 🐾 Github Footprint

⚡I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with others. This is why I share most of my work on Github for others to see. My hope is that some day someone will find my work useful.

## 📈 Github Performance

⚡I do my best to keep a healthy work-life balance. Since I'm still a student who also has to work full-time, I sometimes find it hard to maintain all other aspects of my life in balance which results in a decline in Github activity. However, I do my best to keep this balance and to not disrupt the flow.

## 🏆 Github Achievements
⚡ With the free time I have, I always try to do something valuable for myself and for others. These content I upload to Github has allowed me to achieve quite a lot within a very small amount of time. These small achievements make me motivated to continue expanding my skillset and to share more and more with others on the internet. I hope I'm able to continue this all throughout my journey as an engineer.

## 🗝️ Key Languages

⚡I am interested in a variety of fields. I find myself comfortable mostly in windows programming. However, I am interested in hardware descriptions languages like Verilog as well. On the other hand, I also do low level programming such as C/C++ and Assembly. Eventhough not my strong point, I'm also capable of working with web development tools. When it comes to scripting, I'm quite confident with Python.

```
💻 Visual Basic      ⭐⭐⭐                  💾 C                 ⭐⭐⭐                 💿 C++               ⭐⭐⭐

## 💡Highlight Projects

⚡These are some of the projects that I'm really proud of. I put a lot of effort into them since they can improve my knowledge on certain technologies. I plan to add more projects to this list and to continue developing these even further.

### 01. 💻 Eight Bit Computer Using FPGA
In this project I try to recreate the eight bit computer that [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater) creates in his famous [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU). However, the difference is that I intend to use FPGAs and the Verilog HDL for this task. My goal was to use this as a learning opportunity to sharpen my knowledge in FPGAs and Verilog.
- *Key Technologies* - 𓇲 Verilog | 𓇲 HDL
- *Status* - 🔄 working

### 02. 🔐 Muragala Password Manager
The goal of this project is to create a safe yet simple password manager that is easy to use. With this goal in mind, I created both a Python CLI, a C# library as well as a C# CLI application of it. I am also working on a GUI application based on the C# library. I still continue to improve this application and will add more functionalities in the future.

### 03. 🔥 Prometheus Fire Alarm System
This project was intended to create a next-generation fire alarm system that is both robust and smart. It has the capability to successfully detect and even extinguish fires while also giving full control to the operator remotely. The command panel even has the capability to manage multiple of these fire alarm modules which gives the building much better safety when it comes to fire hazards. I have even uploaded a demonstration to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y) that shows the fire alarm system in action.

### 04. 📩 BitStreamer
BitStreamer is a data streaming software developed for communication engineers to send a bit stream from one COM port and check how many bits can be recieved back from another COM port. Here, the bitstream from the first COM port can be sent through a communication medium to check the efficiency of communication medium.
- *Key Technologies* - 💿 C++ | 🖥️ Visual C# | ♾️ Arduino
- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [BitStreamer](https://github.com/asankaSovis/BitStreamer)

### 05. 📚 Project Akaradiya
Building a database of Sinhala definitions for an English dictionary using crowd sourcing. Anyone can create an account using their email. They can later add words to the dictionary, add definitions to the existing words, vote for the best definition from currently existing definitions that others have added.
- *Key Technologies* - ⌨️ JavaScript | 📱 HTML | 🐘 PHP | 🎨 CSS
- *Status* - ✅ done

### 06. 📌 Indoor Positioning System
The idea of this project is to build a system that uses the existing lights to detect the location of a user within an indoor environment. For this, we can use Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology. The basic concept is to have four LEDs transmitting their IDs one after the other at fixed intervals. The reciever can recieve the IDs and identify how the intensity differs between each LED and decide the position of itself within an environment.

- *Status* - ✅ done (Documenting...)
- *Repository* - [Position_Detection](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Position_Detection)

### 07. 🚘 Metroparking
The main problem identified is the inefficiency of parking implementations. Metroparking is a next level smart parking system that automates the process of reserving, paying and managing parking services in urban parking providers. It is an IoT based project that uses electronics, autonomous and cloud technologies to create a fully automated system to handle parking.

- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [Metroparking](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Metroparking)

### 08. 📡 Bidirectional Transciever
This project was intended to develop a bidirectional transmitter and reciever device that uses Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology to transmit and recieve data from one device to another. In its basic form, data is transmitted as pulses of light where on means bit 1 and off means bit 0. This can be paired with more complicated transmitting techniques to build much more accurate and sophisticated data transmission.
- *Key Technologies* - 𓇲 Verilog | 💿 C/C++
- *Status* - ✅ done (Documenting...)
- *Repository* - [Bidirectional_Transmitter](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Bidirectional_Transmitter)

### 09. 🤖 Project Bionic
Project Bionics intends to build a bio inspired robot that can mimic the nature. The design, based on the 3D models shared by KILIC on PCBWay, can mimic the movement of a spider by using servos. The complete system is controlled by a NodeMCU and is powered by Li-ion battery which makes it portable. The robot can move to the front, back and can rotate to the left and right.
- *Key Technologies* - 💿 C/C++
- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [Project_Bionic](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Project_Bionic)

### 10. 📒 Stick It!
Stick It! is a basic note organizing app that can be used to store and pin notes to the screen. Simillar to the Microsoft Sticky notes, this can be used to write simple notes quickly and easily. Unlike Sticky Notes, this supports markdown and also has the functionality to pin the notes on top of other windows.
- *Key Technologies* - 🖥️ Visual C#
- *Status* - ✅ done (Documenting and Improving...)
- *Repository* - [Stick It!](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Stick-It)

### 11. 🌃 Project Almanac
In this project, we try to use a distributed HPC algorithm to enhance timetable scheduling. Since efficiently distributing events across a timetable is an important part of the world to efficiently manage our day-to-day tasks, this project is crucial for the future of efficient timetable allocation. With the use of HPC, we intend to increase efficiency and find the optimal solution to this problem.
