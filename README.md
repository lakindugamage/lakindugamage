**🤔 Knowing how to code makes you look at the world from a different perspective 🌏. That's why I'm so passionate about coding. Hello World 👋; welcome to my Github profile. I'm still a student and am 24 years of age, so there's a long journey ahead of me 🙆. I like to dream 💬 big and to see other peoples dreams come true. I'm a tech nerd 🐱‍💻 and a coding enthusiast. Hope you might find me amusing.🤩**

🧑‍🔬 As an Mechanical Engineering undergraduate from [CINEC Campus](www.cinec.edu), I'm interested in all things mechatronics and programming related. My goal is to build my company Zydertech, starting from building mobile applications. We are also capable of doing Mechatronics works as well, starting with my project on the 6 Axis Robot Arm. More details can be found in our website (https://zydertech.com).

**Skills:** Electronic Engineering ⚡ | Programming 💻 | 3D Designing & Modeling 📊 | Teamwork 🤝

## 🏆 Github Achievements
⚡ With the free time I have, I always try to do something valuable for myself and for others. These content I upload to Github has allowed me to achieve quite a lot within a very small amount of time. These small achievements make me motivated to continue expanding my skillset and to share more and more with others on the internet. I hope I'm able to continue this all throughout my journey as an engineer.

## 🗝️ Key Languages

⚡I am interested in a variety of fields. I find myself comfortable mostly in windows programming. However, I am interested in hardware descriptions languages like Verilog as well. On the other hand, I also do low level programming such as C/C++ and Assembly. Eventhough not my strong point, I'm also capable of working with web development tools. When it comes to scripting, I'm quite confident with Python.

## 💡Highlight Projects

⚡These are some of the projects that I'm really proud of. I put a lot of effort into them since they can improve my knowledge on certain technologies. I plan to add more projects to this list and to continue developing these even further.

### 01. 💻 6 Axis Robot Arm Project
This project consits on designing and manufacturing an affordable 6 Axis Robot Arm and program the robot arm trajectory using an User Interface (UI) which was developed to run on web browsers.The robot arm is controlled using an Arduino Mega 2560 board and an Ethernet Shield is used to connect the router to connect the Arduino Mega with the internet. The control box can be upgrade to program the robot via WiFi. For the designing of the robot arm, Autodesk Inventor software, and Fusion 360 software for designing the control box are used.The control box is used to place the Arduino Mega control board, stepper motor drivers, and power supplies for the robot arm.
